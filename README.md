## üìú What is ngram-language-model?
ngram-language-model builds statistical N-gram language models from scratch. This application helps users explore tokenization, training, probability modeling, and text generation more easily. It achieves a 97.6% improvement in perplexity from unigram to 4-gram models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a modern Linux distribution.
- **RAM**: Minimum 4 GB recommended.
- **Storage**: At least 200 MB of free disk space.
- **Processor**: 64-bit processor.

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Follow the Download Steps**: Make sure to download the application using the steps outlined above.
2. **Explore Models**: Once the application is running, you can create models using your text data.
3. **Adjust Settings**: Customize parameters like N-gram size to see how models change.

## üß© Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate easily through the application, even if you're not a technical user.
- **Text Generation**: Generate coherent text based on input data.
- **N-gram Modeling**: Build different N-gram models with intuitive settings.
